    <!--    Main focus to improve your code:
            - Follow indenting guidelines (use prettify as easy tool for this)
            - Maintain consistent naming, that is descriptive to what the part does, so other developers will also
            understand it
            - A tip for the future, semantic html will give better idea what part of the code you are in so for example:

<body>
  <header>
    <h1 class="young-serif-regular">Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
  Main content here
   </main>

    <footer class="attribution">

            <!--      Feedback 1:
            Class Naming conventions: Use more descriptive class names to make css easier to understand and maintain
            If you had to read ".whitepart" class in the future, it would be really hard to find out what the class does.
            For example alternative names would be: content-container or recipe-container.


            same with .purplepart, this does not describe what it does, easy altenrative would be: highlight-box
            -->

            <!--    Feedback 2:
            Added an alt attribute to the image for better accessibility, for the users who use a reader,
       that can't see and if the image doesn't load -->

            <p class="outfit-400"> An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten
                eggs cooked

                <!-- Feedback 3:
                Your indenting is not consistent, indenting is the spaces before text, you could try to use
               https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode as plugin for vs code,
               I will indent the code so you can see the difference-->

            <ul class="outfit-400 squarelisting">
                <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
                <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="young-serif-regular borderlines">Instructions</h2>

            <ol class="outfit-400">
                <li><span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are
                    well mixed.
                    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
                </li>
                <li><span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
                <li><span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
                    pan to ensure
                    the eggs evenly coat the surface.
                </li>
                <li><span>Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly
                    runny in the
                    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
                </li>
                <li><span>Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it
                    over the
                    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                </li>
                <li><span>Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
